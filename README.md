# Hardware & Software Verification

This is the homepage of the above-named module, which is offered to MSc and 4th-year MEng students at Imperial College London.

The module is run by [Dr John Wickerson](https://johnwickerson.github.io/).

The Isabelle coursework for 2023 is now available -- have a look in the Isabelle directory in this repository.

The Dafny coursework and the SymbiYosys coursework will follow within the next couple of weeks.

All coursework is to be done in pairs. In Microsoft Teams, I have created a spreadsheet that will help you to pair up.

All coursework is due at 23:59 on Friday 15 December (the last day of Autumn term), and can be submitted by email.
