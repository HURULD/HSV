# Hardware & Software Verification

This is the homepage of the above-named module, which is offered to MSc and 4th-year MEng students at Imperial College London.

* The module is run by [Dr John Wickerson](https://johnwickerson.github.io/).

* All coursework is to be done in pairs. I will create a spreadsheet that will help you to pair up.

* All coursework is due at 23:59 on Friday 13 December 2024 (the last day of Autumn term).
